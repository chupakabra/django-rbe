### RBE Network

> The main purpose of this page is to connect people who consider themselves advocates for a Resource Based Economy or certain aspects of it. With creating a profile you will have the possibilities to add a text about yourself, list specific interests and skills you have as well as sharing your location so that other people can contact you.

> The medium term goal of this project is to create a single hub that connect all tools that are useful for organizing activism, learning about the concepts of a Resource Based Economy, learning about science and technology and objective inquiry and reason on aailable data.

> The system is open for registration to anyone and once registered you can see other people's profile, their skills and their location. You can then start a conversation with people by sending them message - either because they are close to you or because they have skills or interests that you want to talk about with them.
